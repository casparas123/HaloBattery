"""Glorious Model O / O- / D / D- Wireless over their 2.4 GHz receivers (#281, #221).

The current models (258a:2022 Model O, 2024 Model O-, 2023 Model D, 2025 Model D-)
publish vendor collections on `ffa0` and `ffff`; the battery is read with
Sinowealth's framed feature-report query, documented and confirmed on real
hardware by Rodrigo-200/GloriousBatteryMonitor-Go (`HidDeviceService.cs`), whose
comment credits AwesomeTy18/GloriousBatteryMonitor,
glorious-mouse-battery-system-tray, glorious-indicator and OpenRGB's
SinowealthGMOWController. The same query, with the same DevSel, is what
korkje/mxw sends to all four models (src/report/battery.rs, `bfr_w[3]=0x02`,
`bfr_w[4]=0x02`, `bfr_w[6]=0x83`, level in `bfr_r[8]`), opening interface 2.

    request  (64-byte feature report, report id 0):
        00 | 00 00 02 02 00 83 | 00 ...
        index 1-2 reserved, DevSel 0x02 = wireless mouse via the dongle,
        CmdType 0x02 = battery query, Func 0x83 = battery status
    reply:
        [0] report id, [1] status (A1 awake, A2 waking, A4 asleep),
        [2..5] echo, [6] 0x83, [7] charging (0 = no, non-zero = on the charger),
        [8] level %

The receiver needs ~100 ms between the write and the read: the query goes over the 2.4 GHz
link to the mouse and back. Report id 0x00 is the one all known Glorious wireless mice
answer on; other ids are only tried if Windows says the collection takes a different
length.
