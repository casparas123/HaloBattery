"""MCHOSE wireless mice on the 2.4 GHz receiver (M7 Ultra 5253:1020 confirmed on hardware).

Protocol from MCHOSE's own driver, recovered and documented by @alexfrih in
github.com/alexfrih/mchose-linux (PROTOCOL.md, from the M HUB web bundle), which covers
the 0x5253 family: L7/L7 Pro/L7 Ultra, M7, A7, K7. What this mouse forced on top of that
document, all of it measured on the M7 Ultra with firmware 5.2.7.0:

  * the configuration collection is usage page 0xFF01. The sibling collection on the same
    interface (0xFF0B, usage 0x104) never answers anything, on any report id or length.
  * two report ids: 0x11 (20 bytes) and 0x12 (64 bytes), both *feature* reports. Reads are
    written as feature reports too; output reports are not used.
  * every payload byte is inverted (^ 0xFF), padding included, so a zero tail goes on the
    wire as FF FF FF.
  * a reply echoes cmd ^ 0xFF in byte 1 and inverts its payload from byte 2.
  * 0x06 returns: vid:u16, model:u16, firmware:u32, flags:u8, level:u8, charging:u8 and
    then a second level/charging pair with the same values. Charging is 1 while the mouse
    is on the cable, 0 otherwise. The flags byte reads as the radio link state (0x09 on
    the dongle, 0x00 while wired).
  * **it must be re-asked for every attempt.** One request followed by repeated reads only
    ever returns the request itself (raw, then decoded, alternating) - the reference
    driver's "retry the read" advice is what makes this work here, and about one exchange
    in two carries a real answer anyway.
  * **the receiver only answers while the mouse itself is awake.** Asleep, it still answers
    the frame, but with an all-zero payload: measured here as eight seconds of zeros
    followed by the real 100% the moment the mouse was moved. It is the mouse's idle timer
    that decides, so a silent mouse is a normal state - keep the last value on a greyed-out
    icon, exactly like a Razer mouse that has gone idle, rather than calling it a fault.
  * the receiver also pushes a device-info notice on input report 0x13 (01 01 00 <level>
    02 03 06 <..> "M7 Ultra"), which independently reported the same level.

Also measured on the cable: the mouse answers on its own wired PID (5253:0031 - the same
number it reports as the model id) with the same collection and the same command, while
the receiver goes quiet, so the charging source wins and the icon stays single.

The G7 is a different chip on a different vendor id (A8A5:2255, 'YJX-CHIP', while the
0x5253 receivers are RealTek) and speaks a different protocol, worked out by @kek353 from
their own monitor and the HID dump in issue #8: a 65-byte output report starting
``00 55 30 A5 0B 2E 01 01 01``, answered by an input report starting ``AA 30`` whose byte 8
is the level and byte 9 the charging flag. Its vendor collections are 0xFFA5:0x88,
0xFF05:0x88 and 0xFF01:0x10; only the last one is written to, as in @kek353's monitor.
**Confirmed on @kek353's own G7** (issue #8): the probe answers
``aa 30 a5 0b 0a 01 01 01 2e 00 00 00``, so byte 8 = 0x2E = 46% and byte 9 = 0 while the
mouse sits on its dongle, and that level is the one their tool shows. On its cable the same
read answers ``aa 30 a5 3c 0a 01 01 01 2e 01 00 00`` (byte 9 = 1 while charging) with the
PID unchanged, so a G7 keeps a single icon the way the M7 Ultra does.

The 0x3837 family is the same protocol on MCHOSE's newer vendor id: the reference driver
"treats both identically" and matches on the vendor id plus the vendor collection rather
than by model list, which is what this provider does as well. The diagnostics in issue #4
(a MCHOSE A7 V2 Ultra, 3837:100b, RealTek strings, collections 0xFF0B:0x104 and
0xFF01:0x01 on interface 2) have exactly that shape, and the reference documents the status
read on the *short* 0x11 report, so both report ids are tried before a poll gives up.

The first-generation A5 Pro Max (0x2023 - the 1K receiver F013, the 4K receiver F015 and the
wired mouse F019; issue #149) speaks a third exchange, taken from the community web driver
z750sasr/mchose-a5-pro-max-web-driver (MIT, whose transport the independent Klegus/mchose-macos
table agrees with for the same ids): 64-byte *feature* reports on the vendor collection, usage
page 0xFFFF preferred, report id 0. The request carries route 2 (mouse) at byte 2, its own
length 2 at byte 3, page 0 at byte 4 and command 0x83 at byte 5; the reply is the report read
back, starting with the 0xA1 marker and echoing page and command at its bytes 4 and 5, with
charging in byte 6 (non-zero) and the level in byte 7 - clamped to 100, exactly as the
reference clamps it. The reference writes once, waits its 34 ms, then reads back up to eight
times with one re-send in the middle; silent means the mouse is asleep. **Unverified until the
reporter of #149 runs it** - his diagnostics pin the receiver (2023:f013, product string
'MCHOSE A5 2.4G', vendor collections ffa0:0001 and ffff:0001 on interface 1, ffff:0000 on
interface 2).

Not verified: the 0x3837 family (the device in issue #4 is not here), other models, and the
meaning of the second level/charging pair in the 0x5253 reply (it has matched the first pair
in every reading so far).
